## Lessons Learned
Here are my top 10 things that I have learned from working on this project

1. Breadboard your design before you make your PCB.
2. Troubleshooting the code is very annoying.
3. Make sure that VOFF is grounded.
4. Make sure you power your chips and sensors, power does not go through a capacitor.
5. Communicate with your teamates.
6. For an analog sensor use an osilloscope to check the power before and after amplification to see that the op-amp is working.
7. Wire your voltage regulator correctly, it will get very hot if you dont.
8. Wire power from your barrel jack port correctly or else you wont get power.
9. For the UART make sure the settings are correct and you are using the correct ports.
10. Make sure you use an analog pin on the microcontroller for your sensor.

## Recommendations for future students
1. Go to office hours a lot and make sure to ask a lot of questions.
2. For the labs, work on them before class as they take a long time to try and figure out.
3. Try to get your assignments done early, you will need the time to get ahead.
4. Make sure to double check your schematic, any errors will come back and become a problem.
5. Check your PCB that you have enough space to fit all of your components.
