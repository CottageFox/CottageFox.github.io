title: Individal Block Diagram
---

## Overview
This diagram helps to show my specific project for our team project. I will be using a 5V, 1.5A voltage regulator which will power everything. I will be using an IR Emitter/Detector connected to an op amp which will filter and amplify its signal so the microcontroller can read it. This will measure the distance from our device to a wall. If it detects that our device has moved a certain distance away from the wall, it will output a digital signal that will say if the door is closed or open into pin 5 of 2 ribbon cable. That cable will connect to 2 of my teamates microcontrollers.

My block diagram helps to meet our team product requirements as I have a sensor that is outputing an analog signal, that is then getting amplified by an op-amp and going into the microcontroller. I have an LED and Button for debugging, and am outputting to 2 ribbon cables that connect to 2 of my teamates.
