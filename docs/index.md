## Introduction

* This needs to be updated so that a reader gets an idea of the purpose of this datasheet.

In this datasheet I will show an overview of my subsystem for Team 209's project. It explains the functionality of my subsystem, the specific components used and how they work together, the circuitry that combines them all, and how it connects to my teammates systems. 


### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.

Our project is to create a door sensor that will sense if it has been opened, then sound an alarm and lock the door. We will be using microcontrollers along with sensors, buttons, and actuators to accomplish this. My subsystem design is the sensor part which will detect if the door has been opened and output a signal to my teamates systems. The brains behind my subsystem is a Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano which is a microcontroller. It can read the inputs from my sensor and then determine the distance of our system. It will then send the signal to an 8 pin ribbon cable connector that will connect to my teamates systems. The system is powered by a 9V wall power supply connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator to ensure the system gets the correct power. However, this is just my part of the project, you can find the rest of our report [here.](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-209.github.io/)
