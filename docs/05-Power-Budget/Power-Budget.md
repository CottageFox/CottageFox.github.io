title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
I made a power budget for my components by finding their datasheets and finding the specific voltage levels they need and how much current they draw. I then put in a voltage regulator to make sure it has enough power output that works with the specific components. I then put in a 9V wall power adaptor that will power everything. We made a power budget to ensure that enough power and current is going into this project, so nothing gets shorted or draws too much current than the system can handle, breaking things.
