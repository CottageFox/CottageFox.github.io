title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
I made a power budget for my components by finding their datasheets and finding the specific voltage levels they need and how much current they draw. I then put in a voltage regulator to make sure it has enough power output that works with the specific components. I then put in a 9V wall power adaptor that will power everything. We made a power budget to ensure that enough power and current is going into this project, so nothing gets shorted or draws too much current than the system can handle, breaking things.

## Conclusions

The power budget has helped me to estimate how much power my system needs. I only have 3 components so my power needs are very low. I am only using a +5V rail so my design is fairly simple. My ultrasonic sensor draws a small amount of current, and my op-amp draws a very small amount of current. From the power budget I determined that I have enough power for my components using the voltage regulator we have been using.
