### Version 2.0

If I were to do my design again, there are a few things that I would change. First of all I would wire my Op-Amp differently as at the moment it is not getting power. The power for the Op-Amp is going through a capacitor so no power will actually go to the chip. I would also remove the resistor next to my voltage regulator as I did not know that it was a load resistor and not needed to work the regulator. I would improve my design for my IR Emitter / Detector as it was made last minute and just copied from class. It was very cramped and the sensor could not move as it was right on the breadboard. I would have improved it by soldering on wires to the sensor so I could move it around as it's range is short.
