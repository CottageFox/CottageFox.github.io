## Overview

My schematic here has a 9V power supply connected to a fuse in case too much power gets passes through. Which is then connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator that will supply everything with power. I then have an ultrasonic sensor connected to the Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano which then sends a signal back out to the sensor. Then it has an LED and a push button for debugging. It sends a signal out to a ribbon cable connector that will connect to my teamates systems.
