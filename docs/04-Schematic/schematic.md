## Overview

My schematic here has a 9V power supply connected to a fuse in case too much power gets passes through. Which is then connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator that will supply everything with power. I then have an ultrasonic sensor connected to an op amp to amplify its analog signal which connects to the Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano.  Then it has an LED and a push button for debugging. It sends a digital signal out to 3 ribbon cable connectors that will connect to my teamates systems.
