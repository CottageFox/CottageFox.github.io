## Overview

My schematic here has a 9V power supply connected to a 3A fuse in case too much current goes through. Which is then connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator that will supply everything with power. I then have an IR Emitter Detector connected to an op amp to amplify its analog signal which connects to the Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano. There is an LED and a push button for debugging. It sends a digital signal out to 2 ribbon cable connectors that will connect to my teamates systems.
