<br>
**Choice:** Option 1: OPB732 Long Distance Reflective Switch

**Rationale:** This is the best choice as it is small, has a good range and we have used it in class, option 2 is the same as option 1 but with wires, however I think they will be more annoying to solder trying to use flimsy wires compared to the stiff wires in option 1.

    | Cheap                                                   | Has 3 pins that dont connect to anything        |

<br>

**Choice:** Option 1: MCP6004-I/P

**Rationale:** This op amp has 4 op-amps which is useful when needing multiple its better to have them on the same chip instead of buying multiples. While it is the most expensive of the 3, it is very cheap. It is a through hole component and has a very low current draw, so it fits well within the project requirements.

**Choice:** Option 2: L7805CV

**Rationale:** This is the voltage regulator that we have been using in class, so it will be easy to use as we have used it before. These coponents all do the same thing just are made by different companies and are slighly different. This voltage regulator is a great choice for our project requirements of needing 5V and 1.5A of current outputed by the voltage regulator.

### Decision making process:
I selected components that would suffice my part of the project. I needed to choose a sensor that could detect how far away our device was from a wall. So, I decided on an IR Emitter/Detector pair. I had 3 choices and ultimately went with my first choice. We have used this in class and it is small with a good range. Option 2 was good but I think the wires would be more annoying to try and breadboard/solder with, and option 3 was bulky with a very small range. Then I had to choose an op-amp to amplify the analog signal from my sensor. I had 3 choices, my first choice has 4 op-amps, my second choice has 2 op-amps and my third choice has 1 op-amp. I chose my first option as it is the one we have been using in class, and it allows me to add more op-amps in the future if I need to and is very cheap. Then I had to choose a voltage regulator. I had 3 choices and they were all about the same, just different makers. I went with my second option as it is the one we use in class, but they would all work and do the same thing.
