We will be using microcontrollers along with sensors, buttons, and actuators to accomplish this. My subsystem design is the sensor part which will detect if the door has been opened and output a signal to my teamates systems. The brains behind my subsystem is a Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano which is a microcontroller. It can read the inputs from my sensor and then determine the distance of our system. It will then send the signal to an 8 pin ribbon cable connector that will connect to my teamates systems. The system is powered by a 9V wall power supply connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator to ensure the system gets the correct power. However, this is just my part of the project, you can find the rest of our report here.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My part of this project is to design the sensor subsystem that will determine how far away our device is from a wall. I have an ultrasonic sensor that sends a signal to the microcontroller which then sends a signal back to the ultrasonic sensor so it can continue reading.

From there I can determine how far away the device is from a wall and send that signal to my teamates systems. </p> <p>This datasheet has sections with more information on the specifics of my subsystem.

I needed to choose a sensor that could detect how far away our device was from a wall. So, I decided on an ultrasonic sensor. I had 3 choices and ultimately went with my second choice. The first one did not have an analog output, and the third choice was too expensive as well as it is a surface mount part. My second choice has an analog output but is a bit expensive, however it was the best choice for my subsystem. Then I had to choose an op-amp to amplify the analog signal from my sensor. I had 3 choices, my first choice has 4 op-amps, my second choice has 2 op-amps and my third choice has 1 op-amp. I chose my first option as it is the one we have been using in class, and it allows me to add more op-amps in the future if I need to and is very cheap. Then I had to choose a voltage regulator. I had 3 choices and they were all about the same, just different makers.
