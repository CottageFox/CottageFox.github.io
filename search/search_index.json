We will be using microcontrollers along with sensors, buttons, and actuators to accomplish this. My subsystem design is the sensor part which will detect if the door has been opened and output a signal to my teamates systems. The brains behind my subsystem is a Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano which is a microcontroller. It can read the inputs from my sensor and then determine the distance of our system. It will then send the signal to an 8 pin ribbon cable connector that will connect to my teamates systems. The system is powered by a 9V wall power supply connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator to ensure the system gets the correct power. However, this is just my part of the project, you can find the rest of our report here.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My part of this project is to design the sensor subsystem that will determine how far away our device is from a wall. I have an ultrasonic sensor that sends a signal to the microcontroller which then sends a signal back to the ultrasonic sensor so it can continue reading.

From there I can determine how far away the device is from a wall and send that signal to my teamates systems. </p> <p>This datasheet has sections with more information on the specifics of my subsystem.

Option 2 was good but I think the wires would be more annoying to try and breadboard/solder with, and option 3 was bulky with a very small range.

I chose my first option as it is the one we have been using in class, and it allows me to add more op-amps in the future if I need to and is very cheap. Then I had to choose a voltage regulator. I had 3 choices and they were all about the same, just different makers.

I would also remove the resistor next to my voltage regulator as I did not know that it was a load resistor and not needed to work the regulator. I would improve my design for my IR Emitter / Detector as it was made last minute and just copied from class. It was very cramped and the sensor could not move as it was right on the breadboard. I would have improved it by soldering on wires to the sensor so I could move it around as it's range is short. I would also improve on my header pins, I had enough but I feel like it would have been useful to try and have a pin connected to all of my unused pins.
