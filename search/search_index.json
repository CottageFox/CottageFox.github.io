We will be using microcontrollers along with sensors, buttons, and actuators to accomplish this. My subsystem design is the sensor part which will detect if the door has been opened and output a signal to my teamates systems. The brains behind my subsystem is a Microchip PIC18F5Q43 Curiosity Nano which is a microcontroller. It can read the inputs from my sensor and then determine the distance of our system. It will then send the signal to an 8 pin ribbon cable connector that will connect to my teamates systems. The system is powered by a 9V wall power supply connected to a 5V 1.5A voltage regulator to ensure the system gets the correct power. However, this is just my part of the project, you can find the rest of our report here.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li>This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction</li> <li>Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest.

If it detects that our device has moved a certain distance away from the wall, it will output an analog signal into pin 7 of a ribbon cable.
